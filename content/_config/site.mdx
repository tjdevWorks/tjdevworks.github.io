Tejas Mahajan is a software engineer specializing in large-scale data systems and applied machine learning, with experience building production-grade platforms that power mission-critical financial and machine learning powered software applications. Recently at MerQube, I architected their scalable equity and options data pipelines and unified data access layers that support complex index computation workflows. My background spans distributed systems, cloud-native infrastructure, and end-to-end ML deployment, from research-grade deep learning models to containerized, serverless production systems. I’m particularly interested in building intelligent, reliable systems at the intersection of data infrastructure, robotics, and autonomous decision-making.
