## Overview

Developed a Generative Adversarial Network model to convert images into a cartoonized style and shipped it as a full web application.

## What I built

- End-to-end deployment of Cartoonizer as a serverless application on Google Cloud Run.
- Video inference optimization and containerized deployment across Cloud Run and Algorithmia.

## Results

- Used by over 200,000 users.
- Used to cartoonize a short film selected at multiple festivals.
