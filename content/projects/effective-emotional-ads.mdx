## Overview

Defined emotional components of ads using arousal and valence signals, then modeled ad effectiveness through learned visual predictors.

## What I built

- Emotion score mapping pipeline based on sentiment-tagged corpus.
- Effective score proxy using user-response heuristics.
- Fine-tuned DenseNet-121 models for arousal, valence, and effectiveness prediction.

## Results

Accepted as a poster at the CVPR Understanding Visual Advertisements Workshop (Salt Lake City, 2018).
